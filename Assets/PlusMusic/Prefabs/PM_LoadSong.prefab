  developerComments: 'Use this script to load songs from your PlusMusic project.


    NOTE:
    While playing a scene in-editor, the song cache may result in a delay of audio
    when loading a song. We''re aware of this issue and working on a fix. This does
    not affect in-game play.


    - ''Song Id''

    Load song using the unique
    Song ID found in your PlusMusic project

    - ''Song Array Index''

    Load
    song using the song''s array index in your PlusMusic project

    - ''Load On
    Start''

    Load song at scene start (disable if you use triggers)

    - ''Play
    After Load''

    Plays song immediately after it is loaded (disable if you are
    scripting playing behavior)

    - ''Player Root Object''

    Reference to your
    player object, used as trigger collider. NOTE: This does not have to be the player,
    any other collider will do. If omitted, any collider will trigger.

    - ''Trigger
    On Enter'' and ''Trigger On Exit''

    Select what action(s) you want to trigger
    this script

    - ''Song Transition''

    Allows you to customize the transition
    from the current audio to this song
