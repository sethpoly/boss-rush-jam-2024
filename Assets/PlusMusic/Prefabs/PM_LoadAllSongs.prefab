  developerComments: 'Use this script to preload (cache) songs that you are using
    in your game to improve in-game loading times.

    It is best to attach this
    script to an initial loading/menu scene at the beginning of your game.


    NOTE:
    While playing a scene in-editor, the song cache may result in a delay of audio
    when loading a song. We''re aware of this issue and working on a fix. This does
    not affect in-game play.


    - ''Load All Songs''

    Ignores the two optional
    lists and preloads all songs in your project

    - ''Load By Song Id''

    Add
    the unique song IDs of each song you want to preload

    - ''Load By Project
    Array Index''

    Add the array indecies of your project songs you want to preload


    -
    ''Delay Execution'' is only needed if this script is added to a scene that also
    has ''PMLoadSong'' scripts set to ''Load On Start''.
